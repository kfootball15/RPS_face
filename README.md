## Walkthrough:

Rock Paper Scissor Face is quite Simple:

Two Players are matched against each other in a game of Rocks Papers Scissors Shoot!, except instead of hand gestures, we use Facial expressions! The catch here is that, since we are using webcams, the loser must take an embarrassing photo of themselves which the winner gets to keep forever in their 'Dog Tags'.


To play, two players open up a connection and begin to play the game. When you have connected with another player, a green bar appears at the top of your image capture screen.

First, you make your facial expression of choice (Either happy, sad, or angry), and click (or press Enter) to play your turn.

Once your opponent has played his/her turn as well, a winner and a loser are decided.

The loser must be true to his/her word, and make the embarassing face requested by their opponent.
